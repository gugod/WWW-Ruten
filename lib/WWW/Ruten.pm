=head1 NAME

WWW::Ruten - Scripting www.ruten.com.tw

=head1 VERSION

This document describes WWW::Ruten version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::Ruten;

    my $ruten = WWW::Ruten->new;
    $ruten->search("iPod");
    $ruten->each(sub {
        my $result = shift;

        print $result->{title};
        print $result->{url};
    })

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 INTERFACE 


=over

=item new()

Creates a new ruten object and returns it.

=item search( $term )

Search something. $term is a string, required.

=item each( $coderef )

After calling C<search>, you then call this method, give it a
callback. The callback will be called for each item in the search
result. The first argument passed to the callback is a hashref
containing the information. At this point, it has "url" and "title"
keys. This might be changed in the future.

Notices that, the content inside L<www.ruten.com.tw> response is
encoded as big5 text. This module internally decoded it into Perl
strings and returns it to you.
